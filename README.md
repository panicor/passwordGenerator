# passwordGenerator
Generates password based on user input
In this homework, we used JavaScript to create a password generator. The user confirms which characters they would like to include, and how long they want the password to be. Personally, I used conditional statements and for loops to achieve this. The math part of cycling through the random characters threw me off a little, but I used a new empty array to concatenate the final password.
